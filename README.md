# Starset - VR space simulation



Starset is the technical implementation submitted as a partial requirement for the degree of BSc (Hons) Computer Science at the School of Computing, Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen

##Implementation and techinal requirements

The project has been built in Unity 2020.3.26f1, and as a requirement to run the demo, Blender needs to be installed on the local machine.

## Initialize project

If a scene has not been initialized once the project has been opened, please navigate to the Scenes folder, and double click on the Solar System scene asset. This will instantiate the scene, allowing the demo to be started via the Play button, located in the top-middle part of the Unity user interface.

##After start

Once started, the demo allows the user to navigate through procedurally generated immitation of the Solar System. Currently the demo consists of 3 procedurally generated planets, one satelite and a star. This efficiently represents the main functionality of the procedural generation with the different types of stellar objects, as well as their interactions based on physics laws.
